I'm a computer science student and software developer with a passion for technology and open source initiatives. My focus is on creating high-quality, scalable software solutions that meet the needs of clients and end-users alike.

In my career, I've worked on some exciting projects, including real-time communication services using WebRTC and websockets, as well as contributing to the development of internal design system libraries. I have extensive knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and front-end development, and I'm always looking to expand my skill set.

Ever since I joined GitHub 4 years ago, I pushed 8314 commits, opened 16 issues, submitted 1719 pull requests, received 32 stars across 36 personal projects, and contributed to 43 public repositories.

Would you like to find me?
