I'm a software developer and computer science student passionate about technology and open source initiatives. As a programmer, I am constantly searching for best practices and learning new things.

In my career I have participated in the development of complex applications, including real-time communication services using WebRTC and websockets. I have also been involved in the development of internal libraries as a design system. I have extensive knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and front-end development.
