I am a software developer and computer science student, passionate about technology and open source initiatives. As a programmer I am in constant search for best practices and also trying new things.

In my career I have participated in the development of complex applications including real-time communication services using WebRTC and websockets. I have also been part of the development of internal libraries as design systems. I have extensive knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and Front-end development.
